                            OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that is widely used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It was first introduced in 1992 and was quickly adopted as the standard rendering interface. In this project, KAT Systems built a playground using OpenGL and GLUT, a wrapper for OpenGL which can be used to easily create primitives.

                        Various camera based operations are defined in the camera.h file. We used the GLM package to optimize vector and matrix operations. The camera is first setup by specifying its position, the point it is looking at and the up vector required to define the view coordinate system. Various other properties like aspect ratio, near distance and far distance are also specified. The position is specified using the setupPosition function and other properties are set using the setProperties function. After finishing the setup, various operations can be performed using the camera. In our model, you can use the keyboard to move the camera around using the move function. The pitch, yaw and roll functions allow you to rotate the camera about the various axes. Finally, the setModelViewMatrix function is used by the various functions to update the view coordinate system.

                            Using GLUT primitives we designed 5 objects - a slide, a swing, a merry-go-round, monkey bars and a bench. We also used the primitives to make the ground, the wall surrounding the area, paths, etc.

                        	A Ferris Wheel modelled in Blender was imported into the playground. The wheel body, with its narrow faces were made by using the bevel-wireframe trick in Blender. First, a normal cylinder was created and the disks at its end, along with some portion of the trunk were extracted. The structure was then bevelled to generate the narrow surfaces. Following this, the wireframe filter was applied which eliminated all the earlier faces, leaving us with the structure. The seats were generated by slicing and contorting a cube, followed by applying repeated sub-diving of the surfaces to produce a high polygon-count structure. The colors were added to the diffusion property of the material, and were read likewise by the parser.

                            The Blender objects were exported into the wavefront obj format. A parser, written in C++ was generated was used to read these files. Since we have been experimenting with lighting, the normal information was also included along with the mesh information. The texture information (the UV coordinates) were completely omitted and the parser was written to handle the same. The color information was extracted from the “Kd” field of the material description in the mtl files.

                        	Being rather unfamiliar with Blender, it was difficult to get a hang of the basics, especially the camera movement within Blender. Apart from this, rather simple operations like subtraction, intersection etc. have to be performed using some convoluted procedures, which was again difficult to figure out.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Parsing the .obj and the .mtl files was again fairly difficult, as the format seems slightly counter-intuitive. Besides, since we did not use Blender material properties (which would require writing shaders), we had to cherry pick the ones that best represented the color of the object.
